# Why Dosaku?

The field of AI agents is exploding. OpenAI is currently leading in technical capability, but there will be others soon
clamouring to the topâ€” Google, Apple, X. It seems likely that all of these companies will develop closed-source, 
cloud-based agent components. Dosaku is an open-source effort to make all of these individual components accessible and 
compatible within a single framework. 

Another major aim of the project is to help modularize AI agents such that developers may roll their own agent 
applications, copyright and dependency free. That is, as open-source equivalents of top AIs become more widely 
available, Dosaku seeks to enable drop-in replacement.

Specifically, the goals of Dosaku are:

1. Provide a single open-source framework to define an interface into the major AI player services;
2. Enable plug-in-play replacements for local AI components;
3. Help support the open-source community develop and safely distribute the benefits of AGI AI agents.
