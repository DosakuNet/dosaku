# Dosaku

An open-source, personal AI assistant.

# Installation

Create a virtual environment, and then do one of the following.

If you plan on developing the package further, install all the dependencies with:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you plan on simply using the package for your own projects, install Dosaku as a standalone package:

```commandline
python setup.py install
```

# Usage

## Quickstart

The default personal AI assistant agent class is *Agent*.

```python
from dosaku import Agent

agent = Agent()
```

You can see what your agent can do with:

```python
agent.tasks  # []
```

Which will print a notably empty list. Fortunately your agent can learn! Let's learn and try 'Chat':

```python
agent.learn('Chat')
agent.tasks  # ['Chat']
response = agent.Chat.message("Hello, what's your name?")  # "Hi, I'm EchoBot."
```

## Tasks and Actions

Note the way in which we used our agent. Our agent learned the *task* "Chat". This task defines an *action*, "message". 
(As a quick aside: tasks are python classes, and thus get python class naming conventions, i.e. `TheyWillLookLikeThis`. 
Actions are python methods, and thus get python method naming conventions, i.e. `they_will_look_like_this`). In general, 
we get our agent to *do* an action with:

```python
agent_name.TaskName.task_action()
agent_name.TaskName.another_task_action()
```

To find out what *actions* a particular task gives you access to, you can ask your agent for the associated Task API:

```python
agent.api('Chat')  # ['message']
```

Which will list out all the actions associated with that task. For more detailed information on the task, including how
to use each action, you may request any documentation provided by the task creator:

```python
agent.doc('Chat')  # 'Interface for a generic conversational chatbot.'
agent.doc('Chat', action='message')  # "Send a message to the agent and get a response. Args: ... Example: ..."
```

Which is roughly equivalent to the following:

```python
from dosaku.tasks import Chat
Chat.__doc__  # 'Interface for a generic conversational chatbot.'
Chat.message.__doc__  # "Send a message to the agent and get a response. Args: ... Example: ..."
```

## Learning New Tasks

The base Agent will not know any tasks by default. To see what your agent can learn, you may ask it:

```python
agent.learnable_tasks  # ['Chat', 'RestoreFaces', ...]
```

Which will print out a notably longer list. Tasks may do nearly anything. The RestoreFaces task, for example, will 
restore disfigured or low-quality faces in an image. We can see how to use this task with:

```python
agent.api('RestoreFaces')  # ['restore']
print(agent.doc('RestoreFaces', action='restore'))
```

Which will print the following text, including a complete example on how to learn and use the `restore` action.

```text
Restore faces in given image.

    Args:
        image: The input image. It may contain one or more disfigured or low-quality faces.

    Returns:
        A RestoreFaces.RestoredImage object containing, at minimum, the restored_image. Individual modules may also
        provide the individual cropped faces, both before and after correcting, if able, but are not obligated to
        do so.

    Example::
        from PIL import Image
        from dosaku import Agent
        from dosaku.utils import draw_images

        agent = Agent()
        agent.learn('RestoreFaces')

        image = Image.open('tests/resources/hopper_photograph.png')
        restoration = agent.RestoreFaces.restore(image)

        draw_images((image, restoration.restored_image), labels=('Original', 'Restored Image'))
```

Running the above example, we get the following results:

## Tasks and Modules

Dosaku is meant to bridge the world of humans and AI. As such, there are two fundamental *spaces* which define the key 
concepts to the Dosaku platform: *tasks* and *modules*.

Tasks live in the human space. They are the things we want our AI assistant to be able to do: "*play chess*", "*extract 
the text from a pdf document*", "*text-to-image*" (i.e. create an image given a text prompt). Each of these *tasks* 
takes a human concept and defines an explicit API. Some tasks, like "Chat", define only a single associated action,
while other tasks, like "PlayGo", define a rather involved API compatible with the 
[go text protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Text_Protocol), including multiple individual actions and 
maintaining state between them.

In either case, the task translates a human concept into an explicit machine API interface. Tasks do *not* implement the 
actual code necessary to *do* the task and its actions. In the above example, however, when we learned RestoreFaces we 
actually *did* the action "restore". As programmers may have guessed, tasks are abstract interface classes and, at least 
in python, cannot even be instantiated. What, then, is actually *doing* the task? What is it that our agent is learning 
when it "learns"?

The answer is a Module.

Modules live in the machine space. They are programs that do *something*. Modules can be anything, really. To be used by
Dosaku, however, they must register (i.e. claim that they can do) at least one Task. When we ask Dosaku to 
*learn* something, what we are doing is asking Dosaku to *load* (download, install, load into memory, etc.) a *module* 
program able to do the *task*. Later, when Dosaku does the *Task*, what it is actually doing is running the *module* 
program. 

Following the above RestoreFaces example, you can see what tasks your agent knows and which Modules have been loaded 
with:

```python
agent.tasks  # ['RestoreFaces']
agent.loaded_modules  # ['GFPGAN']
```

RestoreFaces is an abstract base class defined in [dosaku.tasks.restore_faces.py](dosaku/tasks/restore_faces.py). It 
defines the abstract method *restore* and includes the documentation returned with `agent.doc()`. The actual 
implementation for the task, however, is defined in a module called GFPGAN, located in 
[dosaku.modules.tencent.gfpgan.py](dosaku/modules/tencent/gfpgan.py). GFPGAN is an open-source 
[published model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04061) created by Tencent, available from 
[github](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN). 

You can find out more information about this module by checking its docs:

```python
from dosaku.modules import GFPGAN

print(GFPGAN.__doc__)
```

Which will print information regarding using the module, including the following two samples:

```text
from PIL import Image
from dosaku.modules import GFPGAN

gfpgan = GFPGAN(arch='RestoreFormer')

image = Image.open('tests/resources/hopper_photograph.png')
restoration = gfpgan.restore(image)
```

```text 
from PIL import Image
from dosaku import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.learn('RestoreFaces', module='GFPGAN', arch='RestoreFormer')

image = Image.open('tests/resources/hopper_photograph.png')
restoration = agent.RestoreFaces.restore(image)
```

The two examples are almost identical, except one uses the module as a standalone python module, and one has a Dosaku 
agent learn and manage the module for the user. We will see some of the advantages of using a Dosaku agent soon, but 
note the general structure of Dosaku: 

- **Tasks** translate a high-level *task* into a human-interpretible machine API;
- **Modules** implement one or more tasks;
- **Agents** communicate with a user, ultimately learning and doing *tasks* for the user; in the background the 
    agent is managing modules (and services, described later), to actually do the tasks.

## Agents

As seen in the face restoration example above, modules are, in general, standalone python modules that can be used 
independently of Dosaku, which may lead you to ask what, then, are Dosaku *agents* doing?

Agents provide the following key functionalities:

- They provide a chat-based communication interface for users to declare requests; 
- They manage the modules required to do the requested tasks;
- They "understand" the Dosaku task-module system and are able to write *new* modules for the user, which they can 
subsequently learn and use as any other module.

In other words, the goal of a Dosaku agent is to be an end-to-end personal assistant, able to speak to the user in plain 
English, break down any user query or request into executable steps, and carry out those steps to complete the user's 
request. In the background the agent manages potentially a dozen or more AI models, where no more than one or two may 
fit on a GPU at a time. The agent should also be capable of creating new modules *de novo*. That is, eventually, the 
agent will be able to carry out user queries even if no module is currently available to carry out the task.

## Named Agents

The generic Dosaku *Agent* class does not preload any modules, and is thus of limited use starting off. Named Dosaku 
agents are simply agents that preload a set of modules on initialization, and thus have some immediate utility out of 
the box. You can make your own, customized agent by sub-classing from the Dosaku Agent class, and then loading any 
desired modules on init.

The main named agent included within Dosaku is *Dosaku*, which can be loaded with:

```python
from dosaku.agents import Dosaku

agent = Dosaku()  # ValueError: Dosaku requires services to be enabled. Pass in enable_services=True on init.
```

Which will actually throw the error shown above. In this case, Dosaku is saying that services must be enabled because it 
wants to use OpenAI's GPT for its base chat functionality. You will not be able to use the Dosaku agent without setting 
up the OpenAI service.

Before continuing, however, it is important to ask and understand the answer to *what, exactly, are services?*

## Services

Services are modules that are run through the interwebs. OpenAI's ChatGPT is a service, as is Stability AI's Clipdrop
(image generation) API. 

To use services, you must provide the appropriate API keys in your [config.ini](dosaku/config/config.ini) file. To use 
the Dosaku agent, for example, you must first go to [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/), create an account and 
copy/paste your OpenAI API key into your config.ini file next to API_KEYS/OPENAI. You can access this API key 
programmatically with the following:

```python
from dosaku import Config

config = Config()
config['API_KEYS']['OPENAI']  # Should show your API key
```

Once your API key is set up, you may use a service in the same way you'd use a module:

```python
from dosaku import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.learn('Chat', module='OpenAIChat')  # RuntimeError
```

Which will *not* work by default, instead throwing an important error: 

```text 
Loaded module was a service, but services have not been enabled. Enable services or load a non-service module.
```

This error message is very important. When you use services, you are implicitly agreeing to:

    1. Send your data over the interwebs;
    2. You are probably spending money;

Because of these facts, services and modules are kept distinct within Dosaku.

Comparing Modules and Services:

|                                                       | Modules | Services  |
|------------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|:---------:|
|                  May download data from the interwebs |    x    |     x     |
| May run code from the interwebs on your local machine |    x    |     x     |
|                        May send data to the interwebs |         |     x     |
|                                        May cost money |         |     x     |
|                                  Computation location |  Local  | Interwebs |

In general, only use modules you trust, as they are likely downloading data (AI models with associated weights) to your
machine, where they will subsequently be run. And, definitely, only use services you trust *and* understand how much 
money using them costs. There are no limits within Dosaku itself— so before you ask the OpenAIChat module to generate a 
hundred-thousand word novel, it would be a good idea to [look at OpenAI's pricing](https://openai.com/pricing). 
Currently, gpt-3.5-turbo costs $0.002 per 1k tokens and gpt-4 costs $0.06 per 1k tokens. That is, the standard gpt-4 
model with an 8k context may cost up to 48 cents per call. Using Dosaku to write standalone modules will make, at 
minimum, 5 calls to GPT, meaning a single *ponder* call (more on that later) may cost up to $2.50, *at minimum*. 

In practice, it is generally not nearly that expensive. Still, you are wholly responsible for how much money Dosaku 
spends on your behalf.

Note that if you haven't signed up to a third party service, given them your credit card number, and copied the
associated API key into your Dosaku config file, nothing in Dosaku will cost money and, hopefully, the worst that can 
happen is you download a model too big for your machine and crash it. If you have done those things, however, 
because you e.g. want to use ChatGPT to power Dosaku, then you are completely responsible for how much money Dosaku 
spends using those services. 

Dosaku is made to be as autonomous as possible, and may be configured to make as many calls as required to fulfill a 
given user query. By continuing, you are implicitly acknowledging that you are willing to allow Dosaku to spend money 
through any services you have enabled (by providing an associated API key into your config file). Ultimately, you 
acknowledge that you are responsible for what Dosaku does and, if you don't like what it is doing, it is open source 
and, as such, you are free to change it to better suit your needs.

With that, to enable services and continue, place your API key into your config file, and then create a simple chat app:

```python
import gradio as gr
from dosaku import Agent

agent = Agent(enable_services=True)
agent.learn('Chat', module='OpenAIChat', model='gpt-3.5-turbo', stream=True)

def predict(message, _):
    for partial_response in agent.Chat(message):  # __call__() defaults to message()
        yield partial_response

gr.ChatInterface(predict).queue().launch()
```

Launch a browser to the displayed URL (http://localhost:7860 by default) and try the following prompt:

```text
Write a tic tac toe program between a human and an AI player. Make the AI player play perfectly.
```

Which should output a functioning tic-tac-toe game in python.


## Text to Image

```python
agent.enable_services()
agent.learn('TextToImage', module='ClipdropTextToImage')
image = agent.TextToImage.text_to_image('Dosaku playing a game of go')
image.show()
```

Which should show a lovely image of our namesake Dosaku, as generated by Stability AI's Stable Diffusion API.

## Working with Dosaku

Adding knowledge and abilities to Dosaku revolves around creating new modules it can learn. For more details on how to 
write new tasks and modules, refer to the [developer readme](/dosaku/README.md). One powerful service Dosaku comes 
with, however, is called **Ponder**. Ponder (attempts to) automatically create new modules for you. Ponder uses OpenAI's 
GPT-3.5/GPT-4, and so requires an OpenAI API key. Once you have put an API key into your config file, you may try the 
following:

```python
from dosaku import Agent

agent = Agent(enable_services=True)
agent.learn('Ponder', model='gpt-4')

new_task_description = (
    'Implement a game of tic tac toe between a human and AI. At minimum, include methods new_game, make_human_move, '
    'make_ai_move, show_board and play. The play method should put all the other methods together into a complete game. '
    'You should display the board between moves, and ask the user for their move on their turn. After the game display '
    'the result as well.'
)

agent.Ponder(reqs=new_task_description, write_to_file=True, save_filename='tic_tac_toe.py')
```

The above will create a new TicTacToe task and module. Specifically, it will generate five new files, each filling their
associated 'pondered' directory:

    1. dosaku.tasks.pondered.tic_tac_toe.py: Detailing a new TicTacToe task.
    2. dosaku.modules.pondered.tic_tac_toe.py: The actual implementation for a TicTacToe module.
    3. dosaku.samples.pondered.tic_tac_toe.py: A standalone sample on how to use the module.
    4. dosaku.app.pondered.tic_tac_toe.py: An end-to-end gradio app incorporating the module.
    5. tests.pondered.test_tic_tac_toe.py: A unit test suite for the new module.

For example, here are the task and module files for a GPT-4 using the exact task description above:

```python
from abc import abstractmethod
from dosaku import Task


class TicTacToe(Task):
    """Interface for a game of tic-tac-toe between a human and an AI."""
    name = 'TicTacToe'

        """
        raise NotImplementedError


TicTacToe.register_task()
```

```python
from dosaku import Module


class TicTacToeAI(Module):
    name = 'TicTacToeAI'

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

                    self.board[i][j] = self.players[1]
                    return

    def show_board(self) -> None:
        for row in self.board:
            print(' | '.join(row))
            print('-' * 9)

    def play(self) -> None:
        self.new_game()
        self.show_board()
        for _ in range(9):
            if self.current_player == 0:
                row = int(input('Enter the row for your move: '))
                col = int(input('Enter the column for your move: '))
                self.make_human_move(row, col)
            else:
                self.make_ai_move()
            self.show_board()
            self.current_player = 1 - self.current_player


TicTacToeAI.register_task(task='TicTacToe')
```

The app given to run the above model:
```python
from dosaku import Agent


def tic_tac_toe_sample():
    agent = Agent()
    agent.learn('TicTacToe', module='TicTacToeAI')

    while True:
        agent.TicTacToe.play()

        play_again = input('Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ')
        if play_again.lower() != 'yes':
            break
            
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tic_tac_toe_sample()
```

Which runs and works. In this case Dosaku has forgotten to implement a method to check who won, which usually is 
included in the implementation. In any case, results are still a work in progress. 


## Dosaku GUI
